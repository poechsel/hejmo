# Hejmo

Project for mercari's hackathon.

## Idea

Our goal is simple: using Machine Learning and collaborative filtering, we want to let you find and share interesting experiences with people who share your tastes, all around the world.

Imagine this: youâ€™re new to Paris, and you're looking for a nice place to eat. We match you with people who enjoy the same kinds of restaurants as you did back in your home city, and use this to find the perfect spot: not something out of a tourist guide, but a place that locals who share your tastes, love.

The suggestions of the existing guides and review apps like TripAdvisor or Yelp are often too general, because they are written by and for tourists. You won't have to spend hours reading blogs and websites to find this secret hidden place that will make your journey, our app will find it for you. 


## Technologies:

Python and Javascript (Vue.js, React Native).
